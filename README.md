## Design Pattern: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
is a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:
- #### Models 
  - hold application data. They’re usually structs or simple classes.
- #### Views 
  - display visual elements and controls on the screen. They’re typically subclasses of UIView.
- #### View models
  - transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. They’re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.
